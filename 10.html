<p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
  It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
 HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br>
 With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
 HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br>
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. <br>
Tags such as <strong>"img"</strong> and <strong>"input"</strong> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.<br>
Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br>
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.<br> Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.<br>
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.<br>
 A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the "canvas" element, in collaboration with javascript.</p>
